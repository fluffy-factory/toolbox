**Toolbox is absolutely not a framework.**  
It's about a ***<span style="color: #5c63ff">toolbox</span>***, hence its name :grin:

Make your choices and pick them up.  

This toolbox is separated into three parts for now, which are:
***<span style="background-color: #cf649a; color: #ffffff">&nbsp; Scss &nbsp; </span>***
***<span style="background-color: #f7e018; color: #000000">&nbsp; Javascript &nbsp; </span>***
***<span style="background-color: #5c63ff; color: #ffffff">&nbsp; DevTools &nbsp; </span>***  

Each part provides many basic components like buttons, form elements for **Scss**,
helper functions to add some interaction with **Javascript** and in **DevTools** you will find a livereload and an iconfont generator.
